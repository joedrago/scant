Scant

>**scant** /skant/ *adj.* - barely sufficient or adequate.

The barest of barebones game engine necessary to make simple games for my kids.

(This repo will probably also house those games. Any pixel-exact resemblances to actual games or characters, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.)
